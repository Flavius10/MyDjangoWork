Project: CodeShowcase – A GitHub-like Project Sharing Platform
CodeShowcase is a web-based application developed using Python and the Django framework, designed to simulate the core idea of GitHub by allowing developers to upload, showcase, and explore project ideas. The platform enables users to create accounts, submit project descriptions, and upload related images to visually represent their work. The goal of the project was to foster a collaborative environment where developers can present their creations, get inspired by others, and share ideas within a centralized system.

The application was built following the MVC (Model–View–Controller) architectural pattern, ensuring a clear separation between the data models, user interface, and business logic. Django’s structure allowed me to manage models efficiently through the ORM, create dynamic views, and design reusable templates for a consistent front-end experience.

Key features of the platform include:

    User authentication (registration/login)

    Project upload module with title, description, and image support

    Project browsing interface where users can view shared projects

    A clean, responsive UI built with Django templates and styling components

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with full-stack development in Django, and reinforced my understanding of web architecture, database modeling, file handling, and MVC principles. It also gave me practical insight into user experience considerations and backend–frontend integration.
